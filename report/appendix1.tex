\subsection{Results for Top Nouns in Chinese and German}\label{firstresult}
After annotation, we analyzed all idioms in the dictionary and found the most frequent nouns occurred. Then we aligned the top 50 Chinese nouns and top 50 German nouns to see if there is any difference in distribution. 

We found top 50 German nouns that can be aligned to the top 50 Chinese nouns and shown in the table\ref{tabletncg}. The table shows the order for each word in the top list (e.g. Mann is the 24th in German list). From the table, we can find 29 out of 50 nouns are aligned. The number is reasonable since we have only 50 vs. 50 alignment. In the table, it is shown that the nature phenomena are more frequent while they are less frequent in German.

Another table aligning Chinese nouns to top 50 German nouns is shown in \ref{tabletngc}. Since that we use a longer list for Chinese (containing top 500 Chinese nouns), we have 41 out of 50 matched. Due to this huge list and translation, we have more than one Chinese noun matched to a German noun, but we also provide the order for each words. It is shown that the body parts comes more than other nouns in German, while most of them can also be found in Chinese with relatively high frequency.

\subsection{Results for more language}
After getting the list for frequent nouns in Spanish MWE, we also compared them with our Chinese list. The results are shown in figures so that it is easier to see the difference for distribution. 

\begin{figure}[t]
\centerline{\epsfig{figure=figure1,width=120mm}}
\caption{{\it Top 20 Frequent Noun Distribution in Chinese and German (ordered in Chinese)}}
\label{fig1}
\end{figure}

The figure\ref{fig1} shows the frequency for the top 20 Chinese nouns aligned with German nouns (up to 25th Chinese noun). The y-axis shows translation-Chinese-German for each item. As is discussed in \ref{firstresult}, body parts are more frequent in German compared to nature phenomena in Chinese. 

\begin{figure}[t]
\centerline{\epsfig{figure=figure2,width=120mm}}
\caption{{\it Top 20 Frequent Noun Distribution in Chinese and Spanish (ordered in Chinese)}}
\label{fig2}
\end{figure}

The figure\ref{fig2} shows the figure for Chinese and Spanish. The alignment is harder than with German since we used up to 47th Chinese noun to get 20 matches. Compared to German version, although less match in most frequent nouns, but the distribution for the matches are more similar in respect of the absolute frequency number.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centerline{\epsfig{figure=figure4,width=120mm}}
\caption{{\it Top 20 Frequent Noun Distribution in Chinese and Spanish (ordered in Spanish)}}
\label{fig4}
\end{figure}

Figure\ref{fig3} and \ref{fig4} are the alignment for German with Chinese and Spanish with Chinese. The result shows no significant difference. But this time, German was matched up to 39th while Spanish was up to 48th. Compared to \ref{fig1}, the alignment is harder here. One interesting thing is that the frequency in Chinese are much higher than the other two languages for the same noun.

\section{Discussion}

In this section, we will analyze the distribution of frequent nouns in Chinese, German and Spanish. The difference for distribution is due to different reasons. In the following of this section, we will view them in details. 

\subsection{Culture Reason}
It is significant that body parts are more frequent in German and Spanish but nature phenomena in Chinese. One reason may be that MWE in German and Spanish use more body nouns to describe and make metaphor for daily life, but Chinese literatures, especially Ancient Chinese literatures, prefer to depict the great nature rather than human bodies. This preference for literatures in different cultures make the difference in idioms. 

More about this kind of preferences, you may find many nouns like 花(flower), 雨(rain), 云(cloud), 月(moon), 山(mountain) as frequent Chinese nouns. In ancient Chinese literature, such image words are usually used for making metaphor for emotions. But these words are not as the same usage in German and Spanish. 

\subsection{Religion Reason}
In German and Spanish, we all found word for god (German:Gott, Spanish:dios), but we didn't find any related noun in Chinese. The simple reason for this is the religion. God is a noun for Christian, while Ancient Chinese had religion of Buddhism. The noun 佛(Buddha) is also in the Chinese list but with a relatively low frequency (the 223th, with 25 occurrences). This low frequency is also reasonable in our Chinese idiom dictionary because the idioms came from 200B.C. to 20th century, but Buddhism widely spread in Ancient China after 500A.D., and it never became the official national religion in any dynasty of China. Another traditional religion in Ancient China was Taoism, the related noun for it was 道. Unfortunately, this noun is polysemous with other meanings as road, method or doctrine. Although 道 is very frequent in the corpus (15th noun with 127 occurrences), we cannot assign it as a religion related noun. 

\subsection{Natural Reason}
We also found many nouns for animals in all the three languages. But the kind of frequent nouns are different in distributions among the languages. We found dog in all languages (Chinese:狗/犬, German:Hund, Spanish:perro), but we had tiger(虎) only in Chinese, and cat(gato) only in Spanish, and also the fictional creature, dragon(龙), only in Chinese. 
For the animal dog, it appears in all countries of the three, and also very common in the daily life. So idioms tend to contain them in the sayings. But for the animal tiger, it only distribute in Asian, so it is not surprising that we didn't find it in German and Spanish. For the animal cat, it is also a common animal in the three countries, but only a frequent word in Spanish. One reason may be that cat is one of the most favorite animal in Spain. But for the culture reason, cat is usually used as evil in Chinese. So you won't find many Chinese idioms containing cats, but a lot in Spanish.
